Revision files for LC-Computation Thinking, algorithms and Big ) number

This repo contians a pdf version of the slides and programs we used in class. You also have your notes from activities you did in class and your text book.

Learning intentions covered in this section are:  
Strand 1: Computer Systems.  
1.1  Describe a systematic process for solving problems and making decisions.  
1.2  Explain how the power of computing enables different solutions to difficult problems.  
1.3  Solve problems by deconstructing them into smaller units using a systematic approach in an iterative fashion.  
1.6  Explain the operation of a variety of algorithms.  
1.7  Develop algorithms to implement chosen solutions.  
1.8  Evaluate the costs and benefits of the use of computing technology in automating processes.  
1.22 Read, write, test, and modify computer programs.  
1.23 Reflect and communicate on the design and development process.  

Strand 2:  
2.1  Use abstraction to describe systems and to explain the relationship between wholes and parts.   
2.2  Use a range of methods for identifying patterns and abstract common features.    
2.3  Implement modular design to develop hardware or software modules that perform a specific function.    
2.4  Illustrate examples of abstract models.   
2.5. Use pseudo code to outline the functionality of an algorithm.   
2.6. Construct algorithms using appropriate sequences, selections/conditionals, loops and operators to solve a range of problems, to fulfil a specific   requirement.    
2.7  Implement algorithms using a programming language to solve a range of problems.    
2.8  Apply basic search and sorting algorithms and describe the limitations and advantages of each algorithm.    
2.9  Assemble existing algorithms or create new ones that use functions (including recursive), procedures, and modules.    
2.10 Explain the common measures of algorithmic efficiency using any algorithms studied.
